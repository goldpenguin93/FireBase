# FireBase

Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform developed by Firebase, Inc. in 2011, then acquired by Google in 2014. As of October 2018, the Firebase platform has 18 products which are used by 1.5 million apps. 

<h2>History</h2>
Firebase evolved from Envolve, a prior startup founded by James Tamplin and Andrew Lee in 2011. Envolve provided developers an API that enables the integration of online chat functionality into their websites. After releasing the chat service, Tamplin and Lee found that it was being used to pass application data that weren't chat messages. Developers were using Envolve to sync application data such as game state in real time across their users. Tamplin and Lee decided to separate the chat system and the real-time architecture that powered it. They founded Firebase as a separate company in April 2012.

Firebase Inc. raised seed funding in May 2012. The company further raised Series A funding in June 2013 In October 2014, Firebase was acquired by Google.In October 2015, Google acquired Divshot to merge it with the Firebase team. Since the acquisition, Firebase has grown inside Google and expanded their services to become a unified platform for mobile developers. Firebase now integrates with various other Google services to offer broader products and scale for developers. In January 2017, Google acquired Fabric and Crashlytics from Twitter to join those services to the Firebase team. Firebase launched Cloud Firestore, a Document Database, in October 2017

<h2>Services</h2>
Analytics
Firebase Analytics
Firebase Analytics is a cost-free app measurement solution that provides insight into app usage and user engagement.

<h2>Develop</h2>
Firebase Cloud Messaging
Formerly known as Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform solution for messages and notifications for Android, iOS, and web applications, which as of 2016 can be used at no cost.

<h2>Firebase Auth</h2>
Firebase Auth is a service that can authenticate users using only client-side code. It supports social login providers Facebook, GitHub, Twitter and Google (and Google Play Games). Additionally, it includes a user management system whereby developers can enable user authentication with email and password login stored with Firebase

<h2>Realtime Database</h2>
Firebase provides a realtime database and backend as a service. The service provides application developers an API that allows application data to be synchronized across clients and stored on Firebase's cloud. The company provides client libraries that enable integration with Android, iOS, JavaScript, Java, Objective-C, Swift and Node.js applications. The database is also accessible through a REST API and bindings for several JavaScript frameworks such as AngularJS, React, Ember.js and Backbone.js. The REST API uses the Server-Sent Events protocol, which is an API for creating HTTP connections for receiving push notifications from a server. Developers using the realtime database can secure their data by using the company's server-side-enforced security rules Cloud Firestore which is Firebase's next generation of the Realtime Database was released for beta use.

<h2>Firebase Storage</h2>
Firebase Storage provides secure file uploads and downloads for Firebase apps, regardless of network quality. The developer can use it to store images, audio, video, or other user-generated content. Firebase Storage is backed by Google Cloud Storage.

<h2>Firebase Hosting</h2>
Firebase Hosting is a static and dynamic web hosting service that launched on May 13, 2014. It supports hosting static files such as CSS, HTML, JavaScript and other files, as well as support through Cloud Functions.The service delivers files over a content delivery network (CDN) through HTTP Secure (HTTPS) and Secure Sockets Layer encryption (SSL). Firebase partners with Fastly, a CDN, to provide the CDN backing Firebase Hosting. The company states that Firebase Hosting grew out of customer requests; developers were using Firebase for its real-time database but needed a place to host their content.

<h2>ML Kit</h2>

ML Kit is a mobile machine learning system for developers launched on May 8, 2018 in beta during the Google I/O 2018. ML Kit API's feature a variety of features including text recognition, detecting faces, scanning barcodes, labelling images and recognising landmarks. It is currently available for iOS or Android developers. You may also import your own TensorFlow Lite models, if the given API's aren't enough. The API's can be used on-device or on cloud.

<h2>Stability</h2>
Crashlytics
Crash Reporting creates detailed reports of the errors in the app. Errors are grouped into clusters of similar stack traces and triaged by the severity of impact on app users. In addition to automatic reports, the developer can log custom events to help capture the steps leading up to a crash. Before acquiring Crashlytics, Firebase was using its own Firebase Crash Reporting.

<h2>Performance</h2>
Firebase Performance provides insights into an app's performance and the latencies the app's users experience.

Firebase Test Lab for Android And iOS
Firebase Test Lab for Android and iOS provides cloud-based infrastructure for testing Android and iOS apps. With one operation, developers can initiate testing of their apps across a wide variety of devices and device configurations. Test results—including logs, videos, and screenshots—are made available in the project in the Firebase console. Even if a developer hasn't written any test code for their app, Test Lab can exercise the app automatically, looking for crashes.Test Lab for iOS is currently in beta

<h2>Grow</h2>
Firebase Notifications
Firebase Notifications is a service that enables targeted user notifications for mobile app developers at no cost.

<h2>Firebase App Indexing</h2>
Firebase App Indexing, formerly Google App Indexing, gets an app into Google Search. Adding App Indexing promotes both types of app results within Google Search and also provides query autocompletions

<h2>Firebase Dynamic Links</h2>
